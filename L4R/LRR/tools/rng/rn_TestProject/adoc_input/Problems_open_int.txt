| https://rb-tracker.bosch.com/tracker08/browse/ATR-15322[ATR-15322]| Sensor Feedback TX PDU TimeOffset Signal value is half of MCS RX Signal value| Description 

After DID value/MCS RX Signal is written to configure a specifc Timeoffset to the Sensor (say Timeoffset = 22000000) , the value in SensorTimeOffset in SensorFeedback PDU must also be the same value (22000000) as configured via DID/RX PDU. But the observation is the TX signal value is half of the configured value (11000000)

Impact 

There will be a mismatch in the transmitted signal value and  the value configured via DID/PDU for the timeoffset | Minor| No| In Verification

 Local port ID to be used by Sensor Broadcast PDU by the sensor is not macthing with the requirement.

Root Cause:

The Local (Sensor) port number metioned in the requirement is wrongs and needs to be rectified for Sensor Broadcast PDU

Impact: 

XPC related test could not be done by System test team

Limitation:

Foxtrot-13 PJ-IF delivery had XCP disabled, but shall be enabled in Foxtrot-15

The data bytes are manipulated in Rx pdus of Ethernet message. Which leads to improper/incorrect data usage by the sensor.

Impact:

Last two bytes of Rx pdu gets manipulated as a result the data is interpreted wrongly by the sensor and this wrong data is used by the sensor.

The stakeholders who are affected are Radar, DASy, NRCS and Video.| Minor| Yes| Analyzed

The cycle time of LGP PDU's is not matching with the requirements in RBS

 Impact:
CAN wakeup message is continuously triggered every 60ms, but there is no CAN entity/ECU to acknowledge the Wake up message -> which causes CAN Rx Error frames in trace
Limitation: This is a CANoe constraint and ECU needs to acknowledge the CAN wakeup message.

| https://rb-tracker.bosch.com/tracker08/browse/ATR-13990[ATR-13990]| Interrupting Power while flashing FBL with Vflash and if Retry Flashing, flashing Fails| {color:#0747a6}Description:{color}
 When the user performs power interruption during re-flashing via vflash tool the flashing fails in the next re-flashing cycle.

During the test log , the DSP DEM event "RB_SLV_SPU_SBST" is triggered which has led to the reflashing failure.

{color:#0747a6}Root Cause :{color}

Currently we have a planned discussion with DSP team and also on the PJ IF Microcontroller team on the nature of this DEM event and the scenario when this is occurred the feedback is as below "Software cannot cause SBST failure, because SBST detects permanent random hardware failures in fetch and pipeline". So the DEM event under consideration on the occurrence of the hardware failure.

{color:#0747a6}Fix Given:{color}

Currently this does not have any software fix for the behavior and discussion with DSP and PJ IF is ongoing on this.

However since V9.0.0 has some other bug fix related to FBL (related to the multiple response for ECU Reset) and also since we have PJ IF Foxtrot-15 and DSP update, we shall perform re-test for this problem ticket.

Also one of the other solution is to check for the VX Box Firmware version which is used in the test environment.

{color:#0747a6}Impact:{color}
 No impact. Currently no BLU specific re-flashing requirement / use case for system/ iA team/customer

This ticket is considered for testing for internal analysis of the BLU reflashing behavior.| Minor| No| Verified
