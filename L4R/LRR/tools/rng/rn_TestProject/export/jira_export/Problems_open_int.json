        "StakeholderSummary":  "{color:#0747a6}Description:{color}\r\n When the user performs power interruption during re-flashing via vflash tool the flashing fails in the next re-flashing cycle.\r\n\r\nDuring the test log , the DSP DEM event \"RB_SLV_SPU_SBST\" is triggered which has led to the reflashing failure.\r\n\r\n{color:#0747a6}Root Cause :{color}\r\n\r\nCurrently we have a planned discussion with DSP team and also on the PJ IF Microcontroller team on the nature of this DEM event and the scenario when this is occurred the feedback is as below \"Software cannot cause SBST failure, because SBST detects permanent random hardware failures in fetch and pipeline\". So the DEM event under consideration on the occurrence of the hardware failure.\r\n\r\n{color:#0747a6}Fix Given:{color}\r\n\r\nCurrently this does not have any software fix for the behavior and discussion with DSP and PJ IF is ongoing on this.\r\n\r\nHowever since V9.0.0 has some other bug fix related to FBL (related to the multiple response for ECU Reset) and also since we have PJ IF Foxtrot-15 and DSP update, we shall perform re-test for this problem ticket.\r\n\r\nAlso one of the other solution is to check for the VX Box Firmware version which is used in the test environment.\r\n\r\n{color:#0747a6}Impact:{color}\r\n No impact. Currently no BLU specific re-flashing requirement / use case for system/ iA team/customer\r\n\r\nThis ticket is considered for testing for internal analysis of the BLU reflashing behavior.",
