| https://rb-tracker.bosch.com/tracker08/browse/ATR-14926[ATR-14926]| Response not received for DID-F186 In Programming session | {color:#0747a6}Description:{color}

The V8 software , the F186 DID did not provide the response in the programming session.

{color:#0747a6}Root Cause :{color}

In V8 software ECU reset response received two times(before and after reset)which is causing an issue in the transition and DoIP connection duration.

This could possibly have lead to the inconsistent response for F186 DID in the programming session.

Note : Internally when the V8.0.0 is tested in the open sensor bench we could see positive response for F186 ( Failed 2 out of 15 times).
