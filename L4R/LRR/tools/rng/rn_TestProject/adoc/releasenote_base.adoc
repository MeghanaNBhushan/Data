^| The product LRR in its current version has no safety mechanisms implemented. This includes that there is no fail-safe or fail-indicate concept implemented. This also includes that signals from this product can be wrong / corrupted, at a wrong time (delayed or too early) or completely missing. +
The customer is responsible for a safety analysis including risks resulting from the current maturity level of the product LRR. Bosch supports in this analysis on request.
The customer is responsible to implement sufficient measures corresponding to this safety analysis (e.g. safety driver, emergency switch, blocking gateway to the vehicle bus). +
Functions on perception and vehicle level shall consider the maturity level of the product LRR and the vehicle shall be controllable at any time by the driver. Fail safe concept must be independent of sensor data.

[width="100%", cols="2a,8a", options="header"]
|===
// Header
^| Main Function / Feature 
^| Comments 
// Row
^| Location gateway unit (LGU) 
^| The radar sensor and control unit (SCU) contains a radar transceiver operating in the globally harmonized frequency range of 76.0 – 77.0 GHz. Targets in front of the sensor reflect the transmitted radar signal to the receivers. The distance of the target corresponds to the time of flight of the electromagnetic wave. The relative speed of the target is measured as well. The target's angular positions in azimuth and elevation are measured. 
// Row
^| Location data interface 
^| The main function is to send locations on a BroadR-Reach interface. +
The interface is based on the signal specification, 1024 locations are transmitted. 
// Row
^| Configure mounting position 
^| Mounting position is coded via Diag-Interface (Ethernet).  
// Row
^| Receiving ego vehicle data  
^| Read vehicle motion data from central ECU or PC over Ethernet. 
// Row
^| Diagnostic interface 
^| Diagnostic interface based on DoIP/UDS. Diagnostic tester based on Python script which is provided.

The Service Level and Duration of Support for this Release is as mentioned below (see also the general definition in project specific Release and Delivery Strategy, Chapter 4)

The product is supported by our development team, please approach your customer contact in case of any questions/issues +
Advice is to update to newer version of the software when available for the compatible hardware sample. For details refer the  <<table-HW-SW-compatibility-application, Compatibility-Table>>

[#PARTICULARITIES]
== PARTICULARITIES

[.text-justify]
For C samples please consider the following wiring of Vector metrology harnesses for the microcontrollers 1 and 2, based on your sample variant.
In the depicted figure, the upper two harnesses belong to metrology variant "AK2", the lower two to variant "HMDT".

The sensor offers different detection and measurement programs (DMP), which provide different combinations of maximum detection range and range resolution. +
The sensor can either be configured to *auto mode*, so that the DMP is selected depending on the vehicle speed. Alternatively, a *dedicated DMP* can be selected regardless of vehicle movement.

//Check old release note if data needs to be taken over
