The customer is responsible for a safety analysis including risks resulting from the current maturity level of the product LRR. Bosch supports in this analysis on request.
The customer is responsible to implement sufficient measures corresponding to this safety analysis (e.g. safety driver, emergency switch, blocking gateway to the vehicle bus). +
Functions on perception and vehicle level shall consider the maturity level of the product LRR and the vehicle shall be controllable at any time by the driver. Fail safe concept must be independent of sensor data.

.Features
[width="100%", cols="2a,8a", options="header"]
|===
// Header
^| Main Function / Feature 
^| Comments 
// Row
^| Location gateway unit (LGU) 
^| The radar sensor and control unit (SCU) contains a radar transceiver operating in the globally harmonized frequency range of 76.0 – 77.0 GHz. Targets in front of the sensor reflect the transmitted radar signal to the receivers. The distance of the target corresponds to the time of flight of the electromagnetic wave. The relative speed of the target is measured as well. The target's angular positions in azimuth and elevation are measured. 
// Row
^| Location data interface 
^| The main function is to send locations on a BroadR-Reach interface. +
The interface is based on the signal specification, 1024 locations are transmitted. 
// Row
^| Configure mounting position 
^| Mounting position is coded via Diag-Interface (Ethernet).  
// Row
^| Receiving ego vehicle data  
^| Read vehicle motion data from central ECU or PC over Ethernet. 
// Row
^| Diagnostic interface 
^| Diagnostic interface based on DoIP/UDS. Diagnostic tester based on Python script which is provided.

Impact:

The V8 software , the F186 DID did not provide the response in the programming session.

{color:#0747a6}Root Cause :{color}

In V8 software ECU reset response received two times(before and after reset)which is causing an issue in the transition and DoIP connection duration.

This could possibly have lead to the inconsistent response for F186 DID in the programming session.

Note : Internally when the V8.0.0 is tested in the open sensor bench we could see positive response for F186 ( Failed 2 out of 15 times).

{color:#0747a6}Impact:{color}
 The session out from one session to another session takes time.

The active diagnostic session information could not be read in programming session sporadically.

| https://rb-tracker.bosch.com/tracker08/browse/ATR-13990[ATR-13990]| Interrupting Power while flashing FBL with Vflash and if Retry Flashing, flashing Fails| {color:#0747a6}Description:{color}
 When the user performs power interruption during re-flashing via vflash tool the flashing fails in the next re-flashing cycle.

During the test log , the DSP DEM event "RB_SLV_SPU_SBST" is triggered which has led to the reflashing failure.

{color:#0747a6}Root Cause :{color}

Currently we have a planned discussion with DSP team and also on the PJ IF Microcontroller team on the nature of this DEM event and the scenario when this is occurred the feedback is as below "Software cannot cause SBST failure, because SBST detects permanent random hardware failures in fetch and pipeline". So the DEM event under consideration on the occurrence of the hardware failure.

{color:#0747a6}Fix Given:{color}

Currently this does not have any software fix for the behavior and discussion with DSP and PJ IF is ongoing on this.

However since V9.0.0 has some other bug fix related to FBL (related to the multiple response for ECU Reset) and also since we have PJ IF Foxtrot-15 and DSP update, we shall perform re-test for this problem ticket.

Also one of the other solution is to check for the VX Box Firmware version which is used in the test environment.

{color:#0747a6}Impact:{color}
 No impact. Currently no BLU specific re-flashing requirement / use case for system/ iA team/customer

This ticket is considered for testing for internal analysis of the BLU reflashing behavior.| Minor| No| Verified

The sensor can either be configured to *auto mode*, so that the DMP is selected depending on the vehicle speed. Alternatively, a *dedicated DMP* can be selected regardless of vehicle movement.

//Check old release note if data needs to be taken over
